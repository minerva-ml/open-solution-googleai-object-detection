This is an open solution to the [Google AI Open Images - Object Detection Track](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track) :smiley:

## Our goals
We are building entirely open solution to this competition. Specifically:
1. **Learning from the process** - updates about new ideas, code and experiments is the best way to learn data science. Our activity is especially useful for people who wants to enter the competition, but lack appropriate experience.
1. Encourage more Kagglers to start working on this competition.
1. Deliver open source solution with no strings attached. Code is available on our [GitHub repository :computer:](https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-googleai-object-detection). This solution should establish solid benchmark, as well as provide good base for your custom ideas and experiments. We care about clean code :smiley:
1. We are opening our experiments as well: everybody can have **live preview** on our experiments, parameters, code, etc. Check: [Google-AI-Object-Detection-Challenge :chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://app.neptune.ml/neptune-ml/Google-AI-Object-Detection-Challenge).

## Dataset for this competition
This competition is special, because it used [Open Images Dataset V4](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html), which is quite large: `>1.8M` images and `>0.5TB` :astonished: To make it more approachable, we are hosting entire dataset in the neptune's public directory :sunglasses:. **You can use this dataset in [neptune.ml](https://neptune.ml) with no additional setup :+1:.**

## Learn more about our solutions
[Kaggle discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track/discussion) is our primary way of communication, however, we are also documenting our work on the [Wiki pages :blue_book:](https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-googleai-object-detection/wiki). Click on the dolphin to get started [:dolphin:](https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-googleai-object-detection/wiki).

## Disclaimer
In this open source solution you will find references to the [neptune.ml](https://neptune.ml). It is free platform for community Users, which we use daily to keep track of our experiments. Please note that using neptune.ml is not necessary to proceed with this solution. You may run it as plain Python script :wink:.

## Installation
### Fast Track
1. Clone repository and install requirements (check _requirements.txt_)
1. Register to the [neptune.ml](https://neptune.ml/login) _(if you wish to use it)_
1. Run experiment:

:trident:
```bash
neptune run will appear here soon :)
```

:snake:
```bash
python command will appear here soon :)
```

### Step by step
1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-googleai-object-detection.git
```
2. Install requirements in your Python3 environment
```bash
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
3. Register to the [neptune.ml](https://neptune.ml/login) _(if you wish to use it)_
4. Update data directories in the [neptune.yaml](https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-googleai-object-detection/blob/master/neptune.yaml) configuration file
5. Run experiment:

:trident:
```bash
neptune login
neptune run will appear here soon :)
```

:snake:
```bash
python command will appear here soon :)
```

6. collect submit from `experiment_directory` specified in the [neptune.yaml](https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-googleai-object-detection/blob/master/neptune.yaml)
