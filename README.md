This is an open solution to the [Google AI Open Images - Object Detection Track](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track) :smiley:

## Our goals
We are building entirely open solution to this competition. Specifically:
1. **Learning from the process** - updates about new ideas, code and experiments is the best way to learn data science. Our activity is especially useful for people who wants to enter the competition, but lack appropriate experience.
1. Encourage more Kagglers to start working on this competition.
1. Deliver open source solution with no strings attached. Code is available on our [GitHub repository :computer:](https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-googleai-object-detection). This solution should establish solid benchmark, as well as provide good base for your custom ideas and experiments. We care about clean code :smiley:
1. We are opening our experiments as well: everybody can have **live preview** on our experiments, parameters, code, etc. Check: [Google-AI-Object-Detection-Challenge :chart_with_upwards_trend:](https://app.neptune.ml/neptune-ml/Google-AI-Object-Detection-Challenge) and images below:

## Disclaimer
In this open source solution you will find references to the [neptune.ml](https://neptune.ml). It is free platform for community Users, which we use daily to keep track of our experiments. Please note that using neptune.ml is not necessary to proceed with this solution. You may run it as plain Python script :snake:.

# How to start?
## Learn about our solutions
1. Check [Kaggle forum](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-ai-open-images-object-detection-track/discussion/62895) and participate in the discussions.
1. Check our [Wiki pages :dolphin:](https://github.com/neptune-ml/open-solution-googleai-object-detection/wiki), where we describe our work. Below are link to specific solutions:

## Dataset for this competition
This competition is special, because it used [Open Images Dataset V4](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html), which is quite large: `>1.8M` images and `>0.5TB` :astonished: To make it more approachable, we are hosting entire dataset in the neptune's public directory :sunglasses:. **You can use this dataset in [neptune.ml](https://neptune.ml) with no additional setup :+1:.**

## Start experimenting with ready-to-use code
You can jump start your participation in the competition by using our starter pack. Installation instruction below will guide you through the setup.

## Installation
### Fast Track
1. Clone repository, install requirements (check _requirements.txt)

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Register to the [neptune.ml](https://neptune.ml/login) _(if you wish to use it)_ and create your Google-AI-Object-Detection-Challenge.
3. Train RetinaNet:

:hamster:
```bash
neptune send --worker m-4p100 \
--environment pytorch-0.3.1-gpu-py3 \
--config configs/neptune.yaml \
main.py train --pipeline_name retinanet
```

:trident:
```bash
neptune run main.py train --pipeline_name retinanet
```

:snake:
```bash
python main.py -- train --pipeline_name retinanet
```

4. Evaluate/Predict RetinaNet:

**Note** in case of memory trouble go to `neptune.yaml` and change `batch_size_inference: 1`

:hamster:
With cloud environment you need to change the experiment directory to the one that you have just trained. Let's assume that your experiment id was `GAI-14`. You should go to `neptune.yaml` and change:

```yaml
  experiment_dir:  ../GAI-14/output/experiment
```

```bash
neptune send --worker m-4p100 \
--environment pytorch-0.3.1-gpu-py3 \
--config configs/neptune.yaml \
main.py evaluate_predict --pipeline_name retinanet
```

:trident:
```bash
neptune run main.py train --pipeline_name retinanet
```

:snake:
```bash
python main.py -- train --pipeline_name retinanet
```
